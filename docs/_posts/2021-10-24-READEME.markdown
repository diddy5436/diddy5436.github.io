## Hosting a Static Site on GitHub Pages
The purpose of this post is to show you exactly how you can build a static site to host your resume. Your resume will be types out in markdown and your finished site will be hosted on GitHub pages, this site will have some features including a responsive setup so that is can be viewd easily on multiple device screen sizes.

#### Some Preresquisites
Before we get started we need to get a few things set up. First we need a resume formatted in markdown. In order to get this setup, you will first need to convert your current resume, or build a new one in markdown, if you do not know how to write in markdown, then refer to my ["More Resources"](https://diddy5436.github.io/More-Resources) page where I have a link to a few pages where you can learn how to write in markdown.

The remaining set of things we'll need are a Github account, we will use this to host our static site, well as a markdown editor, this will be used to create both your resume and the content of any other pages you may create. A few editors you can try using are :
1. [Byword](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/byword/id420212497?mt=12), it is an app for the mac and the editor I used, it costs $10.99.
2. [MacDown](https://macdown.uranusjr.com), it is also for the mac, however this one is free to use.
3. [caret](https://caret.io), is an editor for windows, it costs $29 and has a free trial.
4. [Typora](https://typora.io/#windows), is also an editor for windows, however it is free to use.

Finally, the most important is Jekyll; Jekyll is a static site generator that is built to work well with GitHub pages. It takes your markdown formatted resume and will serve it as an HTML page on your site.
